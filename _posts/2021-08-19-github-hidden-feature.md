There is a mind-blowing GitHub feature or if I can call it a "secret", that I've just discovered and I need to share with you all. 

## Prerequisites
* GitHub account

## Solution
**Step 1**. Open a web browser and login to your GitHub account.

**Step 2**. Go to any repository you want, public or private if it's yours, or you got the right permissions.

**Step 3**. Press **THE DOT** `.`

**Step 4**. BAM! Congratz! You just open a built-in GitHub IDE.

## Conclusion
Altought it's a good feature, personally I wouldn't use it, except in a situation where I don't have access to my local dev machine, and need to do some quick, immediate updates on a GitHub repo.
