I"*<p>Nginx was created in 2004 by a Russian developer Igor Sysoev as he was frustrated with Apache and wanted to build a replacement capable of handling 10000 concurrent connections with the focus on high performance, high concurrency and low memory usage. Today Nginx serves the majority of the world’s top 1000 websites and whilst this growth is largely due to its performance it’s also because Nginx is relatively easy to get started with. Of course it’s by no means a simple piece of software but it’s really good at making practical tasks such as caching or video streaming. Very easy to implement and there’s a large number of first and third party modules which helps to extend its core functionality. However it’s important to understand that Nginx is a reverse proxy server at its core.</p>
