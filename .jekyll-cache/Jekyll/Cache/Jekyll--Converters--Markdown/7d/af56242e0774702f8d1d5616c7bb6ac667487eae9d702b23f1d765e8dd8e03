I"ë<p>You cannot think of a SQL Server Administration or any kind of a relational and non-relational database administration without the two magic words: <strong>backup</strong> and <strong>restore</strong>. Backing up a database is a part of an essential operation that can prevent disaster scenarioes, like accidental corruption or deletion, and itâ€™s often underlooked when working in a development or staging environment. If you are working as a DevOps Cloud Architect, a part of your responsibilities youâ€™ll have to came up with a good backup and restore plan. This includes having backups on a cloud storage service, for example: Amazon S3, Azure Blob storage. You might also want to add a cold storage solution for long-term retention like Amazon Glacier and Azure Cool Storage, and most likely an on-premises storage solution.<br />
In this post, i will focus on how to backup and restore an Azure SQL Database using the Azure CLI, as a part of the Azure SQL Database Administration series.</p>
