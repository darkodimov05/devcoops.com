I"ı<p>A very common task that iâ€™m used to as a DevOps engineer working in the cloud, is resetting forgotten or lost passwords for server or database access. Although one of the best practices is to store passwords in a key management service, like Azure Key Vault, that i have covered in this <a href="/how-to-create-azure-key-vault-using-azure-cli/" target="_blank">post</a>, people doesnâ€™t always follow security best practices. But, there could be another common scenario where youâ€™ll have to change the password every 3 or 6 months as a part of a password policy, for example the Azure SQL database Administrator password. There is a way to change the password using the Azure Portal that iâ€™ll cover in a future, but today iâ€™ll show you how to change the password quickly and easier from the Azure CLI, as a follow up from the <a href="2019-10-12-how-to-create-and-configure-azure-sql-database-using-azure-cli" target="_blank">â€œHow to create and configure Azure SQL Database using Azure CLIâ€</a> post.</p>
