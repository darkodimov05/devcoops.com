I"Z<p>MySQL is one of the most used open source relation database management system (RDBMS) with a client-server model. It’s most commonly used as a web database, although it can have many other purposes, like data warehousing, e-commerce, and logging applications. If you have ever started working as a System Administrator, Database Administrator, or DevOps engineer, one of first things you’ll have to face is creation or configuration of a MySQL instance.<br />
In today’s post, i will write about creating a MySQL database in the cloud, and i’ll stick with Azure for now. Microsoft’s Azure has a service called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Azure Database Service</code> that is a relation database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL and MariaDB. You can easily create a MySQL server using the Azure Portal, or the Azure CLI.</p>
