I"‰<p>Managing Azure Virtual Machines through the Portal could be pretty straighforward. But, it requires multiple steps using the GUI. For example, youâ€™ll have to login to the Portal first, then go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Azure Virtual Machines</code> service, select the VMs, and then you can start, stop, restart, or even delete the virtual machines. There is also a quicker way to do these operations, especially if you are the SysOps / DevOps guy.<br />
Although, there are three other ways to manage Azure VMs, including PowerShell cmdlets, ARM templates, and the Azure CLI, today iâ€™ll focus on the CLI.</p>
