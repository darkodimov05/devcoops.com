I"Ö<p>As we know Nginx has a lot of great features, one of them is to redirect your website from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code>.

Redirecting the traffic from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code> is the most common task if you are working as a DevOps or System Administrator. Nginx as a reverse proxy web server offers a lot of redirect rules but in this tutorial, we will take a look at the few of them.</p>
