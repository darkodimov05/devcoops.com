I"ø<p>As a part of an Azure SQL Database administration series, this post will be a follow up from the last <a href="/how-to-recover-lost-admin-password-for-azure-sql-database-using-azure-cli/" target="_blank">one</a>, where i will write about renaming Azure SQL database, which is kind of a common scenario for those who work as a DevOps / SysOps cloud engineer.<br />
There are currently three ways to rename an Azure SQL database, as far as i know.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first one is using TSQL, that requires <strong>SQL Server Management Studio</strong>. Run the following query:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ALTER DATABASE [dbname] MODIFY NAME = [newDBname]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Rename using the <strong>SQL Server Management Studio</strong> GUI. Just right click on the database name and click <em>Rename</em>.</li>
  <li>Rename using the Azure CLI, which will be explained in details in the next steps.</li>
</ol>
