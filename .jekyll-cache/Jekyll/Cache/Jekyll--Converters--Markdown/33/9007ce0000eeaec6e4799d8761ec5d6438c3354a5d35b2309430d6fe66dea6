I"B<p>Besides MySQL, MariaDB is another free open source relation database under the GNU General Public License, that is often compared to MySQL. That’s because MariaDB is a fork of the MySQL RDBMS, which means it’s based on the same source code, and usually it’s used for the same purposes, as a web database.<br />
In today’s post, i’ll continue explore the possibilities of creating a relation database using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Azure SQL Database</code> service, using the Azure CLI. In the last post, i’ve explained the simplified steps on <a href="/how-to-create-azure-mysql-database-using-azure-cli/" target="_blank">How to backup and restore an Azure SQL database using Azure CLI</a>, so if you have already seen it, it’s pretty much the same procedure under the Azure Cloud.</p>
