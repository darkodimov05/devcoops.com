I"Ç<p>Azure DNS is a cloud-based DNS hosting service that allows you to host and manage your own domains. These domains are hosted on Azureâ€™s global network of DNS name servers. Keep in mind that you canâ€™t buy a domain name from Azure DNS, instead you can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain#buy-the-domain" target="_blank">App Service domains</a>, or a third-party domain registrar like: GoDaddy, Namecheap, AWS Route53, Google Cloud DNS, and so on. If you already an owner of a public DNS zone, you could just configure the name servers NS records to point to those of Azure. So, why bother hosting on Azure DNS over other domain registrars?!</p>
