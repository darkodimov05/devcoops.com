I"Y<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a globally distributed group of nodes / servers that work together in order to deliver content to end users. The idea behind CDN is to provide high performance and high availability, usually by distributing servers across regions that are geographically closer to the users, to minimize latency. These groups of servers are known as points of presence (POPs), and the servers that host the files are called origin servers.<br />
Most common scenarios include using CDNs for storing cached web static content for blog sites, and media live streaming as well.</p>
